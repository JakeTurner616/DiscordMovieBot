# üé¨ DiscordMovieBot - Ultimate content searching, suggestion, acquisition, and organization system üåê

DiscordMovieBot is a simple Discord bot created to provide users with a robust set of tools for efficient torrent management and seamless online stream searching, all within the confines of a Discord server. The bot establishes a connection with a qbittorrent seedbox, providing your Discord users with an intuitive interface to effortlessly explore and obtain movies, TV shows, books, or add existing torrents via magnet links. DiscordMovieBot is simple in its design and does not use the Radarr/Jackett suite of software as a torrent collection management system. Instead, it utilizes custom api wrappers of popular trackers such as [1337x.to](https://1337x.to), [YIFY](https://yts.mx), [torrentdownload](https://torrentdownload.info), [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/), and others, in conjunction with the qbittorrent Python API. This approach enables seamless, automated management of torrents directly to and from a qBittorrent instance.

## üîß Pre-Install Setup

### qBittorrent setup:

1) Ensure that qBittorrent WebUI access with authentication is configured on the seedbox by enabling the webui feature and adding a user with a password.

3) Add qBittorrent categories for each media type that can be torrented via the leftmost ui panel: "movie", "tv", "fitgirl repack" each with a specified path to their desired download location.

### Discord bot setup:

1) Create a bot via the Discord developer portal making sure to enable message content intents.
   
3) Go to the OAuth URL generation page and give the bot the "bot" scope and all necessary permissions to send messages, reactions, embeds, read messages, embed links, add slash commands, and manage messages. Simply invite the bot to a server.
